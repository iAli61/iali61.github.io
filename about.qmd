I am Ali Bina (PhD), a results-driven AI/ML Scientist and Software Engineering Lead with over a decade of experience architecting and deploying cutting-edge machine learning solutions. With a PhD and a background that spans both academic research and enterprise-level development, I specialize in the application of advanced AI to solve complex scientific and business problems. My core focus lies in Large Language Model (LLM) technologies—including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), agent-based systems, and multimodal AI—where I lead technical initiatives from model pre-training all the way to production deployment.

## My Journey to the Intersection of Atoms and AI

My career has been a journey of scales—from the atomic structures that build our world to the large-scale AI that helps us understand it. It started with a fundamental question: how are things made? This curiosity led me first to extractive metallurgy, studying the raw transformation of materials into the steel and alloys that form the backbone of our industries.
But I wanted to go deeper.
My master's work in nanomaterials took me to the atomic level, where I explored the elegant world of carbon nanotubes and quantum phenomena. This was my first taste of bridging the physical with the computational, moving between hands-on experiments and atomistic simulations. It was here I first encountered the fundamental challenge that would define my career: how can we possibly simulate the vast complexity of materials across time and length scales?
This challenge took me to the Max Planck Institute for my PhD, where I focused on multiscale materials modeling. I spent my days connecting quantum mechanics to real-world material behavior, wrestling with the immense computational cost of first-principles physics. I learned that while our understanding of physics was deep, our ability to simulate it at scale was a significant bottleneck to discovery.

## The Turn to AI: A New Toolkit for Science
My postdoctoral research was the turning point. I realized that to accelerate discovery, we needed a new approach. I began exploring how machine learning could break the simulation barrier. By developing deep-learning-driven interatomic potentials and using computer vision to analyze atom-probe tomography data, I found a way to teach computers the language of physics, enabling simulations that were orders of magnitude faster.
This fusion of disciplines became my focus. At BASF, I transitioned from academia to industry, applying deep learning to solve tangible problems in polymer science. Using variational autoencoders, I modeled complex material properties from experimental data, creating meaningful "fingerprints" for polymers. This wasn't just about prediction; it was about building systems that could enable similarity searches, uncover new sustainable materials, and learn from the vast, unstructured data of scientific research. It was also where I learned that a powerful model is only useful if it can be deployed, leading me to build expertise in cloud architecture and scalable MLOps.
