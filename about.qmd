I am Ali Bina (PhD), a results-driven Senior AI/ML Engineer and Consultant at Microsoft Germany, with over 10 years of hands-on experience in software development, data science, machine learning, and AI. I specialize in the fascinating intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Material Science, focusing on cutting-edge Large Language Model (LLM) technologies, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), agent-based systems, and multimodal AI applications.

My expertise spans from model pre-training and fine-tuning to evaluation and deployment, with deep proficiency in Python (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Hugging Face Transformers), C++, and designing/optimizing complex ML pipelines for enterprise applications.
