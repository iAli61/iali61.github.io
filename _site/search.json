    "text": "Code\n\n\n\n\nYour Role: You are an expert web developer with a specialization in creating modern, professional websites for academics and researchers using Quarto.My Goal: Generate the complete code for a personal website that will serve as my professional homepage, blog, and project portfolio. The website should be ready for deployment on GitHub Pages.About Me & The Website’s Purpose:I am a researcher specializing in the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Material Science. I read and analyze scientific articles daily and want a digital space to:Document My Work: Gradually write down notes, thoughts, and insights.Publish Articles: Polish my notes into formal blog posts.Showcase Projects: Share my project ideas, designs, and code.Personal Branding: Build a professional online presence.My writing style involves extensive use of Markdown, Jupyter Notebooks for code snippets (Python), and Mermaid diagrams for visualizations.Core Requirements:Technology: Use Quarto as the static site generator.Design & Theme:The overall design must be modern, clean, and professional.Use the cosmo Bootswatch theme as the base.Create and link a custom.scss file to override the base theme with specific modern touches.Deliverables:A set of complete, commented code files for the Quarto project.A list of creative and relevant name suggestions for the website.Clear instructions on how to set up and preview the website locally.Detailed Website Structure and Content:Please generate the following files, organized within a single code block with clear file markers (e.g., # FILE: _quarto.yml).1. Main Configuration (_quarto.yml):Project Type: website.Website Title: Use one of the names you suggest as a placeholder.Navigation Bar: Include links for “Home,” “Blog,” “About,” and “Projects.”Footer: Add a simple copyright notice and a “Powered by Quarto” credit.Formatting (format: html):Link the theme as an array: [cosmo, custom.scss].Set a modern, highly readable mainfont, such as “Atkinson Hyperlegible” or “Inter.”Set a base fontsize of 1.1em and linestretch of 1.7 for excellent readability.Link an additional styles.css file for minor CSS tweaks.2. Custom Styling (custom.scss):Override Bootstrap SCSS variables to achieve a modern aesthetic.Background: Add a subtle, light linear gradient to the body background (e.g., #f8f9fa to #e9ecef).Typography: Set the $body-color to a dark grey (e.g., #333) and header colors to a strong, professional color (e.g., #2c3e50).Links: Change the primary link color. Add a smooth transition for the color change on hover.Code Blocks: Style the code blocks with a light background color (e.g., #f1f1f1) and a distinct colored left border (using the $primary color).3. Homepage (index.qmd):A welcoming title and a short introductory paragraph explaining the site’s focus (AI & Material Science).A section titled “Latest Posts” that automatically lists the 3 most recent blog entries.A brief “About This Site” section.4. About Page (about.qmd):Use the trestles template for a modern, professional layout.Include placeholders for:A profile image (profile.jpg).Social/professional links (GitHub, LinkedIn, Email) with icons.A short bio and a “Research Interests” section with a bulleted list.5. Blog Section:Listing Page (posts/index.qmd):Set up a default listing page that displays all posts.Enable UI for sorting by date and filtering by category.Use a full-page layout with a title banner.Sample Blog Post (posts/my-first-post/index.qmd):Create a sample post to serve as a template.Include YAML front matter with title, author, date, and categories.Demonstrate a sample Mermaid diagram (e.g., a simple flowchart) with a caption.Demonstrate a code block (e.g., a Python snippet).Explain that a .ipynb file could be used here instead of a .qmd file.6. GitHub Pages Compatibility:Include an empty .nojekyll file to bypass Jekyll processing on GitHub Pages.Additional Tasks:Website Name Suggestions: Before the code block, provide a list of 5-10 name suggestions for the website. The names should be professional and reflect the themes of AI, Material Science, innovation, and research.Setup Instructions: After the code block, provide clear, step-by-step instructions on how a user should:Create the file structure from your generated code.Install the Quarto CLI.Run quarto preview to view the website locally."
