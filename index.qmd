### Solving the Unseen: Accelerating Scientific Discovery with AI 

The next generation of materials—for sustainable energy, advanced computing, and human health—are waiting to be discovered. I build intelligent systems, from machine learning potentials to AI research agents, to unlock them faster. Explore how we can bridge the gap between simulation and reality.

## My Focus Areas
My work is centered on building the intelligent systems required to solve next-generation scientific challenges. I focus on three key areas:

- AI for Materials Simulation: Developing data-driven interatomic potentials and machine learning models to accelerate the simulation of material properties, reducing the time from hypothesis to discovery.

- Agent-Based Scientific Research: Engineering multi-agent AI systems that can autonomously design experiments, analyze data, and propose new research directions in materials science.

- Enterprise AI & Scalable MLOps: Architecting and deploying robust, production-grade AI systems and infrastructure capable of handling the massive datasets and computational demands of modern scientific research.
