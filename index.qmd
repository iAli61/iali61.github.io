### Solving the Unseen: Accelerating Scientific Discovery with AI 

The next generation of scientific discovery—for sustainable energy, advanced computing, and human health—are waiting to be discovered. I build intelligent systems, from machine learning models to AI research agents, to unlock them faster.

Hi, I'm Ali Bina (PhD), a passionate researcher and engineer at the intersection of science and artificial intelligence. From simulating quantum mechanics to deploying large-scale AI at Microsoft, my work is dedicated to accelerating discovery. This space is for demystifying complex science and exploring the future of AI-driven research.

## My Focus Areas
My work is centered on building the intelligent systems required to solve next-generation scientific challenges. I focus on three key areas:

- **Enterprise AI & Scalable MLOps:** Architecting and deploying robust, production-grade AI systems and infrastructure capable of handling the massive datasets and computational demands of modern scientific research.

- **Agent-Based Scientific Research:** Engineering multi-agent AI systems that can autonomously design experiments, analyze data, and propose new research directions in materials science.

- **Agentic AI for Materials Discovery:** Developing intelligent agents that can autonomously explore the materials discovery space, generating and testing hypotheses at scale.
